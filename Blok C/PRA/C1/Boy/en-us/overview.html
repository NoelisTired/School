            <p> The curriculum at Curio Software is structured into different blocks, each with a specific focus and learning content. 
                In the regular program, it starts with "Block A: Smart City," where students gain knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS to develop Smart City applications. 
                Next, "Block B: Developerland" continues with C# and PHP programming to prepare students for broader development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Block C: 4s + Internship Preparation" focuses on Laravel, a PHP web framework, and prepares students for their internships. 
                Following this preparation is "Block D: Orientation Internship," where students put their acquired knowledge and skills into practice during their internship experience.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                In "Block E: Specialization," students have the option to further develop expertise in specific areas. 
                This is followed by "Block F: Examination Block," where knowledge and skills are tested.

                The regular program concludes with "Block G: Final Internship," where students demonstrate their skills and complete the program. For accelerated progress, there is also an accelerated program available.
